        The Internet has affected virtually every aspect of life since its inception. It has changed the way we communicate, the way we learn, and even what it means to be a celebrity. With the creation of sites like YouTube and Vine, fame is no longer a wildly lucky gift given to a select few by the media. Anyone can be famous because it is the people of the world, the audience, which launches people into the world of celebrity.

        Justin Bieber was one of the earliest examples of a YouTube superstar. As a young teen, Bieber posted vides of himself singing on YouTube. This led to his discovery and subsequent worldwide fame. He did not go through the "teen idol machine," like Disney Channel, but became famous because of something he uploaded to the Internet. Bieber got his start on the Internet, but has progressed to become a more traditional celebrity. However, there are also many celebrities that are strictly Internet-famous, like "Alex from Target."

        The Internet has also transformed how celebrities interact with their audiences. Many sites, like Twitter, allow celebrities to be in direct contact with their fans and communicate with them on a daily basis. This is something that would just not have been possible fifty years ago, before the rise of the Internet. Because it is so easy to become Internet-famous, the Internet can be a dangerous place. Everyone is on a larger platform because of the Internet. This means that instead of 50 people seeing you do something stupid, 100 million could see it.

        As Scott Cook, the co-founder of Intuit, said "We're still in the first minutes of the first day of the Internet revolution." As he so clearly says, the Internet is still young. As much as it has already shaped our world, there is always more to come. The Internet has had, and will continue to have immeasurable, unimaginable affects on the world. From revolutionizing the path to fame, to changing the very way we learn, the Internet has been a catalyst for major change.
